In the existing process, users had to wait in long queues for registration. They also needed to contact the admin to access post details. Our project aimed to eliminate the need for users to wait for admin assistance. It offers a quick and time-saving registration process, enhancing the user experience by making parcel tracking and cost estimation more efficient.
